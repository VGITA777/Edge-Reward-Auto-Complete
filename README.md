# Edge Reward Auto Complete
 This simple python code will automatically complete your daily microsoft reward for you.
 I recommend to only do 10 search at a time to not run into any errors.

In execuiting the file, open the Standalone version folder, then run the main.exe
the main.py is the code used in the portable version, or you can just copy the code and execute it.
This can be also be used to your phone by copying the code then executing it in a python emulator.

Also this will launch your default browser. So make sure that your using microsoft edge as your default browser.
